This is my portfolio page. It's very simple now and a work in progress but if you want to check it out here's a live demo (I know the media is not there yet 😊 ):

PS: The site is under construction 🧙‍♂️ I am moving to React framework to continue working on it. So don't mind the react-version for now pls.

- You can still see the old version tho.

### This is how the progress on the new site is coming along:
